# The Vet Clinic Database

> This Repository is the SQL Schema representation of a vet clinic database

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate the vet_clinic database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
